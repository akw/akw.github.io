# Eliminate media server?
*2022-11-08*

## Background

I think that one of the drives (photos) is dying and making a death rattle. I had bought a new drive and was just thinking that I would replace it. Then starting 11/7, it seems like I couldn't log into the server even after reboot. I've decided that since no one else really uses plex, I can move plex to my adaptus laptop and just sell the media server.

## Layout

Drive attached to office router:

- feature videos
- feature music

Media drive attached to laptop:

- photos
- home videos
- home music

Backup drive attached to laptop

- time machine backup of cindy's machine
- time machine backup of alex's laptop
- media drive backup
- feature music backup?

## Open questions

- maybe Cindy should have her own backup drive?
- OPTION: direct attached drive
  - PROS: less complicated. not dependent on me being preset for it to work. Time machine working as intended
  - CONS: would require unmounting drive every time before disconnecting power
- OPTION: set up an rsync on her documents. would require occassional full backup
  - PROS: backs up the most important part of cindy's files.
  - CONS: less standard technology
- OPTION: network time machine to a time capsule
  - PROS: standard technology
- OPTION: icloud backup

## Notes

Time capsule was discontinued. Networked time machine relies on another mac being present. I think we might need to do time machine on an interim basis and doing rsync maybe to a network drive or to alex's laptop.
